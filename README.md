<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Separation of Concerns: </strong>The game logic is separated into <strong><em>'GameController'</em></strong>, while the UI handling and event binding are in <strong><em>'DisplayController'</em></strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear Interface: <em>'DisplayController'</em></strong> provides a clear interface for manipulating the UI, which <strong><em>'GameController'</em></strong> uses to update the display based on game state changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Modular Structure: </strong>This modular approach makes it easier to manage and understand each part of the code, enhancing maintainability and readability.</li>
  <li><strong>Single Responsibility: </strong>Each module is responsible for a specific part of the application, adhering to the single responsibility principle.</li>

  This structure ensures a clean separation of game logic from display logic, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.
